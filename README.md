# Enumerable

In this project you will learn how to use a module inside your class. For this you will create a class MyList and a module MyEnumerable. Your module MyEnumerable will implement a subset of the functionality of [Enumerable](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.0/Enumerable.html).

The Enumerable mixin provides collection classes with several traversal and searching methods, and with the ability to sort. The class must provide a method each, which yields successive members of the collection. If #max, min, or sort is used, the objects in the collection must also implement a meaningful <=> operator, as these methods rely on an ordering between members of the collection.
